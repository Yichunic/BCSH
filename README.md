# Capstone: Bitumen-Conversion-Using-Slurry-Hydrocracking
**Project Timeline**
Start date: January 2020
End date: June 2020

**Rationale**  
Most bitumen conversion in Alberta is achieved by carbon rejection processes such as delayed coking or ebullated bed hydrocracking. More recently Slurry Hydrockracking (SHC) processes are emerging that promise higher conversion of bitumen to synthetic crude oil. This project will develop economiic basis for an SHC based bitumen upgrader.

**Primary Objective**  
The primary objective is to determine the return on capital of a standalone merchant upgrader using slurry hydrocracking to convert the bitumen into a pipeliine-able synthetic crude.

**Award**  
This project was nominated the *Ken Sury Memorial Prize* (2020) for providing a rigorous and innovative solution.
